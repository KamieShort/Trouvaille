                <h3>A simple start, but built with passion.</h3>
                <p>
                    There is nothing quite like exploring a new land. From tasty dishes and
                    beautiful art to dense jungles and off-road adventures, the world has endless
                    surprises that keep the soul intrigued. At an early age I was exposed to
                    different cultures and new destinations which quickly cultivated my imagination.
                    Discovering similarities and appreciating differences I found that travel moved
                    to the forefront of my lifeâ€™s goals. As thankful as I am to have had these
                    experiences, I want to help you discover the world too. Travel has become a
                    professional passion and I am here to help shape and realize your dreams.
                    Trouvaille Travel Company will be with you every step of the way to your next
                    lucky find.
